# A Maze Thing

AR maze

MVP

-  We are trialling Swift for 2 days (may switch to React Native).

Tier 1

-  Render a maze that a user can walk through.
-  Splash page
-  Home page

Tier 2

-  Make exit for the maze
-  Collision logic: user is unable to walk through walls
-  Randomly generate a new maze

Tier 3

-  Mazes have obstacles, coins to collect
-  Time limit to complete the maze

Tier 4

-  User created mazes: Maze Maker
-  Users can share and save mazes
-  Mazes in different physical locations (i.e. Central Park)
